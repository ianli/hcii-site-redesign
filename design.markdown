Design Document
===============

This is the design document of [Ian Li](http://ianli.com)'s redesign of the [HCII web site](http://www.hcii.cmu.edu).

Example Pages
-------------

* [Home Page](index.html)
* [About HCII Page](about.html)
* [Faculty Page](faculty.html)
* [Publications Page](publications.html)
* [Example Article Page](article.html)

Layout
------

The design of the layout emphasizes scanning from top to bottom instead of breaking content into separate pages or navigation into separate menu bars. This property is evident in the example pages and the side navigation.

Elements
--------

### Side Navigation

The side navigation is a good example of how vertical scanning is emphasized in the layout. The old design's top bar hides links behind drop-down menus. This is inefficient because the user has to look at each of the menus to find the link they want. Instead, the side navigation lists all the relevant pages on the site, which allows the user to easily scan from top to bottom.

### Content Column

The content column also exemplifies scrolling. The example pages are

#### Font Choice

The font I used for the title and headings is [Helvetica Neue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica#Neue_Helvetica_.281983.29).
Helvetica Neue is humanist and ubiquitous, which reflects HCII's human-centered approach to technology that is permeating our lives.
It also complements Carnegie Mellon's wordmark font [Bauer Bodoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodoni).


Pages

### Home Page

The home page should be a lively page that is updated constantly. It should make the user want to come back to the site for more updates. To accomplish this, the redesign has the following things on the home page:

- A banner that cycles through images about the latest news, events, and publications.
- Short descriptions about the latest HCII news, upcoming events, and recent publications are listed, so that users can easily scan through them.

### News

The old site separated news between HCII News and HCII in the Media. I think these pages should be merged into just one section for the following reasons:

1. The old site makes the user visit two separate pages to see all the latest news about HCII. This also meant that users had to subscribe to two RSS feeds.
2. These pages are not updated often enough to warrant their own pages. Putting them together would make the pages actively updated.
3. The old site had a column for HCII News and another for HCII in the Media. The two columns make it harder to scan and clutters the home page. Merged together, they are displayed as a list and is more easily scanned.
